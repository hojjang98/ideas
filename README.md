# 💡 Project Ideas

A personal space for capturing creative sparks — from everyday observations to speculative concepts.  
Some ideas may be technical, others social, artistic, or even whimsical. The only rule: follow curiosity.

## ✨ Purpose  
- Explore and record spontaneous ideas before they fade  
- Express creativity across disciplines — not limited to data or code  
- Revisit, refine, or transform raw thoughts into something real  
- Leave traces of imagination as a form of self-expression

## 🗓️ Creative Rhythm  
I aim to contribute one idea each weekday (excluding weekends and rest days).  
Not every idea will be brilliant or complete — and that’s perfectly okay. This is a habit-building space, not a showcase of perfection.

## 📁 Structure  
Ideas are grouped loosely by topic.
Some notes are brief; others may include sketches, potential data sources, or early solution paths.

Feel free to browse, remix, or revisit anything here.  
Every idea is a stepping stone — even the weird ones.
