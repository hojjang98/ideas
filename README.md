# 💡 Project Ideas

A personal archive of creative sparks — ranging from **technical experiments** to **social insights**, **artistic visualizations**, and even a few whimsical concepts.  
Some ideas may evolve into real projects, others remain thought experiments. The goal is to **follow curiosity and document the journey**.

---

## ✨ Purpose
- Capture spontaneous ideas before they fade  
- Explore creativity across disciplines — beyond data or code  
- Revisit, refine, and transform raw thoughts into real projects  
- Leave traces of imagination as a form of self-expression

---

## 🗓️ Creative Rhythm
I aim to contribute one idea each weekday (excluding weekends and rest days).  
Not every idea will be brilliant or complete — and that’s perfectly fine.  
This is about **building the habit of ideation**, not chasing perfection.
