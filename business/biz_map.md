# 🧠 Project Title: **BizMap — Role-Based Startup Strategy Visualizer**  

---

## 🔍 Summary  
**BizMap** is a data-driven visualization platform that translates real-world business intuition into structured insights.  
By analyzing patterns from experienced founders, it identifies which **roles** (e.g., product planner, marketer, operator, developer) are most critical at each stage of a startup’s growth.  
The goal is to help first-time founders or small teams allocate their time and resources more effectively — replacing guesswork with experience-backed strategy.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Many new founders struggle to understand **which role matters most** in different growth stages.  
- Existing startup guides are **too theoretical** and fail to reflect real execution flow.  
- Lack of intuitive, data-backed insights leads to **misaligned focus** and early burnout.  

**Goal:** Replace generic startup advice with a **visual, experience-based roadmap** that aligns roles with growth stages.  

---

## 💡 Key Objectives  
1. Collect and analyze founder experience data to detect stage-role success patterns.  
2. Build an interactive visualization that shows the **“role importance curve”** over time.  
3. Offer actionable, personalized insights to help teams adjust their role focus dynamically.
