# 🧠 Project Title: FallColorMap — Real-Time Visualization of Autumn Leaf Colors  

## 🔍 Summary  
FallColorMap is a **computer vision-based visualization project** that captures and maps the **color distribution of autumn leaves** across different regions in real time.  
By analyzing user-submitted or public park images, it estimates the **dominant hue ratio (green, yellow, red)** and visualizes it on an interactive map, showing where fall foliage is at its peak.  

This project bridges **environmental monitoring, tourism insight, and aesthetic data analysis**, offering both scientific and emotional perspectives on seasonal change.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Fall foliage data is often limited to **subjective reports or government bulletins**.  
- There’s no **data-driven, real-time system** showing how colors evolve across locations.  
- Color preference varies — some prefer early greenish tones, others the deep red peak — yet no map reflects these nuances.  

**Goal:** Use computer vision to **quantify and visualize** the seasonal transition of leaf colors, making nature’s palette measurable and explorable.

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Autumn foliage attracts millions of tourists each year, yet information about *when and where* colors peak is scattered.  
- Remote sensing data (e.g., NDVI from satellites) shows vegetation change, but lacks **human-scale color perception**.  
- Advances in **image segmentation, color clustering, and geotagged photo analysis** make it feasible to crowdsource real-time visual data.  

This project combines **environmental awareness**, **visual aesthetics**, and **AI-powered mapping** to better understand nature’s temporal beauty.

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **Crowdsourced photos** from SNS platforms (Instagram, Flickr, Naver Blog) with GPS tags  
- **Webcams and park surveillance feeds** from public tourism portals  
- **Satellite imagery** for macro-level color consistency checks  
- **Open data APIs** from weather or environment agencies (temperature, humidity, sunlight)  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **Image Collection:** Gather geotagged images from APIs or user uploads.  
- **Color Analysis:**  
  - Apply **segmentation models (DeepLab, U²-Net)** to isolate foliage regions.  
  - Perform **k-means clustering** or **Lab color space analysis** to identify dominant hues.  
- **Hue Classification:** Classify each region into categories — *Green, Yellow, Red, Brown*.  
- **Mapping:** Use **Folium or Kepler.gl** to visualize hue ratios over time and space.  
- **Temporal Tracking:** Track how average hue shifts weekly per region to show “foliage flow.”

## 💡 Applications  
- **Tourism Insight:** Real-time “Peak Color Map” to plan trips.  
- **Environmental Research:** Quantify how temperature/humidity affect color progression.  
- **Cultural Analysis:** Study color preference patterns via user interaction data.  
- **Aesthetic Dataset:** Provide seasonal color datasets for art or design AI models.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Photos may vary in lighting and saturation — **color normalization** is critical.  
- Need to filter out non-foliage regions (sky, buildings).  
- Privacy handling for user-uploaded data (faces, license plates) required.  
- Geographic and temporal bias may arise (urban vs rural photo density).
