# 🧠 Project Title: LayoutLens — Visual Resume Aesthetics Evaluator  

## 🔍 Summary  
Can a resume’s **visual professionalism** be assessed using computer vision?  
This project explores whether layout quality — alignment, spacing, balance, and readability — can be **quantitatively evaluated** through image analysis of resumes.  

By combining OCR and CV techniques, the system identifies structural or aesthetic flaws and provides **actionable design feedback** to help users create cleaner, more credible resumes.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Most AI resume tools focus only on **content quality** (text clarity, keywords).  
- However, recruiters form a **first impression in 3 seconds** based on layout and design.  
- Currently, there’s no automated way to evaluate **visual composition or layout discipline** in resumes.  

**Goal:** Develop a computer vision system that measures the *visual neatness* of resumes and offers feedback for layout improvement.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Recruiters often associate “clean layout” with professionalism and trust.  
- Poor alignment or inconsistent fonts subconsciously reduce credibility.  
- CV and document-layout analysis (LayoutLM, PubLayNet, DocBank) have matured enough to analyze **visual structure and balance** in resumes.  

This project bridges **NLP-based resume evaluation** with **CV-based visual quality analysis**, creating a hybrid evaluation pipeline.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Public resume templates (Canva, Overleaf, Google Docs) labeled by visual quality  
- Manually rated dataset (Good vs Poor layout) by design students or recruiters  
- Open document-layout datasets (PubLayNet, DocBank) as pretraining resources  
- Synthetic dataset generated by **intentional misalignment and spacing noise**  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **Alignment Detection:** Using OpenCV to measure text block alignment and symmetry.  
- **Balance Scoring:** Analyzing element distribution and whitespace density.  
- **Font Consistency:** Applying OCR + font recognition to detect irregularities.  
- **Contrast Analysis:** Evaluating readability (WCAG contrast ratios).  
- **Visual Aesthetics Regression:** Fine-tune a CNN to predict “visual neatness” score (0–100).  

---

## 💡 Applications  
- **Resume Feedback Tool:** Detect and suggest design improvements (“Too little spacing under section titles”).  
- **Portfolio Evaluator:** Extend to CVs, academic posters, or portfolios.  
- **Recruiter Assistant:** Rapidly filter out visually unstructured resumes.  
- **Education Tool:** Teach layout balance and visual communication for job seekers.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Lighting or scan quality may affect CV-based analysis — preprocessing needed.  
- Must avoid bias toward specific template styles (e.g., Western vs Korean resume formats).  
- Requires careful definition of “visual quality” to ensure fairness and consistency.
