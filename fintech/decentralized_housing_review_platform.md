# 🧠 Project Title: **HomeTruth — Decentralized Housing Review Platform**

## 🔍 Summary  
HomeTruth is a **blockchain-based housing review system** where previous tenants leave **verified, immutable feedback** about their living experience.  
It helps new renters or buyers access information about **real housing conditions** (temperature, noise, water pressure, sunlight, neighbors, etc.) that real estate agents often fail to disclose.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Real estate agents often **hide or downplay negative aspects** of properties.  
- Tenants lack access to **honest, first-hand reviews** of houses or apartments.  
- Online reviews can be **manipulated or deleted**, lowering trust.  

**Goal:** Provide a **transparent, tamper-proof review platform** that empowers renters and buyers.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Many people regret after moving in: *“여름에 너무 덥다, 겨울에 보일러가 약하다, 위층 소음 심하다.”*  
- In Korea and abroad, **rental fraud** and **정보 비대칭** problems are common.  
- Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) ensures that **reviews cannot be altered** once written, creating a **trustworthy housing information ecosystem**.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  
1. **Verified Tenant Reviews** – Only actual past residents can leave reviews (verified via lease contracts or utility bills).  
2. **Blockchain-backed Data** – Reviews stored immutably, ensuring **no tampering or deletion**.  
3. **Living Condition Categories** – Heating/cooling, sunlight, water pressure, noise, neighborhood safety, etc.  
4. **Smart Contracts** – Enable **peer-to-peer housing deals** with transparent conditions (optional).  
5. **Review Reputation System** – Users gain reputation points for leaving detailed, helpful reviews.

## 🛡️ Safeguards Against Tenant Disadvantages  
1. **Anonymous Review Submission**  
   - Proof of residence is verified, but the review itself remains anonymous to protect current tenants.  

2. **Delayed Disclosure**  
   - Reviews are published only after a tenant has moved out (e.g., 3 months later), avoiding immediate financial disadvantages.  

3. **Blockchain Incentives**  
   - Tenants receive token rewards for submitting reviews, offsetting potential risks of devaluing their past property.  

4. **Legal & Reputation Framework**  
   - False reviews are penalized (reputation score deduction).  
   - Verified reviews can serve as **legal evidence** in disputes, strengthening tenant rights.

## 🚀 Potential Impact  
- Increase **trust & transparency** in housing markets.  
- Help young renters, students, and newlyweds make **better decisions**.  
- Pressure landlords and real estate agents to **improve housing quality**.
