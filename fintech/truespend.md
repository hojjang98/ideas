# 🧠 Project Title: **TrueSpend — Context-Aware Personal Finance Analyzer**

## 🔍 Summary  
TrueSpend is a **context-aware personal finance system** that understands the *meaning* behind every transaction.  
It distinguishes between **real consumption, transfers, debt repayments, savings, and investments**, providing a more accurate picture of personal spending behavior.  
Beyond categorization, TrueSpend detects **recurring fixed expenses** and offers **personalized strategies to reduce them**, acting as an intelligent financial coach.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Most finance apps classify *every outgoing transaction* as consumption, even transfers or debt repayments.  
- In reality, financial outflows serve different purposes — such as savings, repayments, or recurring obligations.  
- As a result, users often **misjudge their true spending** and miss opportunities to optimize fixed costs.  

**Goal:** Build a **context-aware financial intelligence system** that accurately distinguishes transaction intent and helps users **reduce unnecessary recurring expenses** through actionable insights.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Existing apps like Toss or Mint provide convenient summaries but lack contextual understanding.  
- Transfers between personal accounts, loan repayments, and recurring utility bills are often all labeled as “spending.”  
- Such misclassification causes confusion about *real consumption* versus *financial maintenance*.  
- By combining AI-based classification with fixed-cost detection, users can achieve **5–15% monthly savings** without major lifestyle changes.

## ⚙️ Key Features  

1. **Smart Spending Classifier (AI-based)**  
   - Categorizes each transaction into `Consumption / Transfer / Repayment / Savings / Investment / Fixed Cost` using NLP and transaction pattern learning.  
   - Continuously adapts through user feedback loops.  

2. **Fixed Expense Detector**  
   - Identifies recurring payments such as telecom bills, OTT subscriptions, insurance, and gym memberships.  
   - Calculates total fixed-cost ratio and visualizes its impact on total spending.  

3. **Cost Reduction Recommendation Engine**  
   - Suggests optimization actions, e.g.:  
     > “Your mobile plan costs 25% above market average — switching could save $130 annually.”  
     > “Two OTT subscriptions show low usage — consider cancelling one.”  
   - Compares spending categories against market benchmarks and peer averages.  

4. **Real Consumption Dashboard**  
   - Clearly separates *real consumption* from *mandatory* or *transfer-based* spending.  
   - Visualizes spending structure by `Fixed vs Variable` and `Essential vs Optional` ratios.  

5. **Personalized Spending Coach**  
   - Provides monthly spending summaries and adaptive recommendations, e.g.:  
     > “Your fixed costs account for 48% of total spending. Aim for below 40% next month.”
