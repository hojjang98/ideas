# 🧠 Project Title: AI Gym Mirror — Smart Form Check & Training Assistant

## 🔍 Summary
AI Gym Mirror is a **computer vision–powered fitness assistant** that corrects user form in real time.  
By analyzing posture through **pose estimation** and comparing movements to ideal references, it delivers **instant feedback, injury prevention, and progress tracking** for gym-goers.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Many beginners struggle with form, leading to poor results or injury.  
- Personal trainers are effective but not always accessible or affordable.  
- Existing fitness apps mostly provide post-workout summaries, not **real-time corrections**.  

**Goal:** Create an accessible gym assistant that delivers instant form feedback, tracks improvements, and enhances safety.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Inspired by the limitations of “mirror checks” in gyms—hard to spot subtle errors.  
- Poor lifting form is a major cause of injury and wasted effort.  
- Advances in pose estimation (MediaPipe, OpenPose) make affordable, real-time form analysis feasible.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- OpenPose/MediaPipe pose datasets.  
- Public fitness movement datasets (e.g., squat, push-up, deadlift).  
- Self-collected data with labeled form correctness.  
- Wearables (optional) for multimodal tracking (heart rate, fatigue).

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Pose Detection**  
   - Extract 2D keypoints using MediaPipe/OpenPose.  

2. **Form Analysis**  
   - Compare joint angles to exercise-specific reference ranges.  
   - Classify reps as “good” or “incorrect” with feedback labels.  

3. **Temporal Tracking**  
   - Use LSTM/sequence models to detect movement quality over time.  

4. **Feedback System**  
   - Real-time alerts: voice guidance, AR overlay, or on-screen tips.  
   - Progress dashboard with accuracy scores and weekly trends.

## 💡 Applications
- **Personal Fitness:** Affordable PT-like assistance in gyms or at home.  
- **Safety:** Reduce risk of injury through posture correction.  
- **Gamification:** Challenges and achievements to boost motivation.  
- **Remote Coaching:** Trainers can monitor clients via recorded sessions.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Accuracy depends on camera setup, lighting, and occlusion (e.g., barbell blocking joints).  
- Privacy concerns when recording workouts must be addressed.  
- Needs dataset diversity to handle different body shapes and movement styles.
