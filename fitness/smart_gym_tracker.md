# 🧠 Project Title: Smart Gym Tracker — Real-Time Machine Availability

## 🔍 Summary
This project builds a **real-time visualization system** for gym machine usage.  
Users can check **machine-level occupancy status** from home (e.g., “Chest Press: 2 people waiting”), helping them avoid peak hours and optimize workout routines.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Many gym-goers waste time waiting for popular machines.  
- Current apps only show **overall gym occupancy**, not machine-level details.  
- Without knowing how long they’ll wait, users face disrupted routines and dissatisfaction.  

**Goal:** Develop a transparent system that shows **usage and waiting status per machine**.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Inspired by Korea’s restroom occupancy indicators, simple sensors can signal “in use” or “available.”  
- Post-COVID, users prefer more personalized and contactless workout experiences.  
- Gyms are moving toward **smart facilities** (smart lockers, IoT machines), making this a natural step.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- IoT sensors on machines (pressure sensors, proximity sensors).  
- CCTV + computer vision for detecting exercise movements.  
- Check-in/check-out logs from member apps.

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Sensor-Based Occupancy Detection**  
   - Attach pressure sensors to machines to track real-time usage.  

2. **Computer Vision Assistance**  
   - Detect movements (e.g., bench press, squat) from CCTV feeds.  

3. **Queue Time Prediction Algorithm**  
   - Estimate “time remaining” based on average past usage durations.  

4. **User App Interface**  
   - Interactive gym map with machine-level congestion.  
   - Notifications such as *“Chest Press will be free in ~3 minutes.”*

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Gym members**: Avoid waiting, plan personalized routines.  
- **Gym operators**: Identify high-demand machines for better planning.  
- **IoT providers**: Expand into fitness equipment tracking solutions.

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Must ensure **privacy** (no face recognition, occupancy only).  
- IoT deployment costs may be high.  
- Variability in workout duration requires robust prediction models.

## 🔗 Related Inspirations
- Public restroom occupancy systems in Korea.  
- Seat-availability apps in cafés and study cafés.  
- Research on IoT-based smart gyms.
