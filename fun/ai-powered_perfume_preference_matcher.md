# 🧠 Project Title: ScentLens — AI-Powered Perfume Preference Matcher

## 🔍 Summary
ScentLens is a mobile and web platform that helps users **discover perfumes** aligned with their **personality, lifestyle, and emotions**.  
It combines **AI-driven recommendation systems** with **emotional profiling**, making fragrance discovery intuitive, personal, and data-driven.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Perfume shopping is overwhelming due to thousands of options and abstract descriptions (“woody”, “fresh”, “oriental”).  
- Many people, including myself, experience **decision paralysis** — leaving stores empty-handed.  
- Current classification systems cater to experts, not ordinary users seeking simple guidance.  

**Goal:** Provide an AI tool that bridges expert fragrance taxonomies with **personalized user preferences and moods**.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Inspired by personal experiences of struggling to choose a perfume despite wanting one.  
- Highlights the gap between **professional fragrance language** and **consumer needs**.  
- Advances in recommendation systems and NLP make personalized scent discovery feasible.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Public perfume databases (e.g., Fragrantica) with note breakdowns.  
- User reviews and ratings from online communities.  
- Questionnaire/survey data collected within the app.  
- Crowdsourced emotional tagging of scents.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Preference Profiling**  
   - Short questionnaire (favorite colors, seasons, travel style).  
   - Generates a **personal scent profile** (e.g., citrus-fresh, woody-elegant).  

2. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Hybrid of collaborative filtering + content-based filtering.  
   - Suggests **safe picks** and **exploratory scents**.  

3. **Mood-Based Matching**  
   - Users log current moods (“focused”, “romantic”, “excited”).  
   - AI recommends perfumes to complement or balance that state.  

4. **Visualization & Community**  
   - Interactive **fragrance universe map** (families: citrus, floral, woody, oriental).  
   - Users share impressions, while AI summarizes community feedback.  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Personalized Perfume Discovery:** Match users to scents they’ll likely enjoy.  
- **Decision Support:** Reduce blind-buy mistakes and wasted purchases.  
- **Community Engagement:** Build a user-driven fragrance platform.  
- **Market Research:** Provide brands with insights into consumer mood–scent relationships.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Fragrance perception is subjective → requires large, diverse datasets.  
- Data availability depends on scraping or partnerships with fragrance platforms.  
- Emotional profiling needs careful design to avoid oversimplification.
