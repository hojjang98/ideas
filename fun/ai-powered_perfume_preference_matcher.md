# 🧠 Project Title: **ScentLens — AI-Powered Perfume Preference Matcher**

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Perfume shopping often feels overwhelming due to the **sheer number of options** and abstract descriptions ("woody", "oriental", "fresh").  
- Many people, including myself, have experienced **decision paralysis** — I wanted to buy a perfume but ended up not buying anything because I couldn’t choose.  
- There is a gap between professional fragrance classification and **what ordinary users actually need**: simple, personalized guidance.  
- By combining **AI recommendation systems** with **emotional profiling**, users can discover perfumes more intuitively and confidently.  


## 🔍 Summary  
ScentLens is a mobile and web platform that helps users **discover perfumes** that align with their **unique personality, lifestyle, and emotional state**.  
It goes beyond traditional “fragrance notes” and leverages **AI-driven preference analysis** to recommend scents, offering users a **data-driven, personalized perfume journey**.
