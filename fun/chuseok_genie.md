## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Annual challenges during Chuseok:  
  1. **Traffic congestion** on the way to family gatherings.  
  2. **Overwhelming meal prep** with unclear portions.  
  3. **Duplicate or unsuitable gifts** due to poor coordination.  
- At the same time, families need **entertainment and bonding activities** to lighten the mood.  

**Goal:** Create an AI-powered service that blends **utility** (planning, coordination) with **fun** (games, memes, fortune-telling).

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Existing apps are fragmented: navigation, recipe, and shopping apps are separate.  
- No single platform addresses the **whole Chuseok experience**.  
- Humor and shareable content (memes, fortune cards) add a **viral element** that can spread via KakaoTalk or social media.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Public transportation & traffic APIs (Kakao Map, Naver, Korea Expressway Corporation).  
- Recipe databases (Korean traditional holiday dishes).  
- E-commerce/charity APIs for gift suggestions.  
- User-input family profiles and preference data.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Traffic Planner**  
   - Predict optimal departure times using traffic APIs.  
   - Simulate congestion based on historical data.  

2. **Meal Calculator**  
   - Input: family size → Output: portion sizes, shopping list, cooking timeline.  

3. **Gift Coordination**  
   - Each family member logs intended gifts.  
   - AI resolves overlaps and suggests unique options.  

4. **Fun Layer**  
   - Fortune cards (“Your Chuseok luck: Avoid uncle’s karaoke challenge!”).  
   - Meme generator for family jokes.  
   - Mini-games (randomized yutnori, family quiz).  

5. **Privacy & Transparency**  
   - User data stored locally.  
   - Only essential API calls for traffic and gift coordination.  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Families:** Less stress, more bonding during the holiday.  
- **E-commerce:** Smarter gift recommendation and upselling.  
- **Transport Services:** Increased use of traffic APIs.  
- **Social Media:** Viral spread of fortune/meme cards.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Seasonal demand → needs off-season repurposing (e.g., Lunar New Year mode).  
- Regulatory checks for data privacy, especially around travel/gift spending.  
- Requires cultural adaptation if expanded outside Korea.
