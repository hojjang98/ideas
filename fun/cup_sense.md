# 🧠 Project Title: CupSense — Smart Hygiene Tracker for Your Daily Mug  

## 🔍 Summary  
CupSense is a smart hygiene assistant that determines **when your daily cup should be washed** based on usage patterns, beverage type, and environmental conditions.  
Instead of washing by “guess,” users receive **data-driven reminders** when bacteria buildup or odor risk increases — making hygiene effortless and personalized.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Most people wash their cups **only when they feel like it’s dirty**, not based on hygiene factors.  
- The **rate of bacterial growth** differs depending on drink type (coffee, milk, tea) and room temperature.  
- Over-cleaning wastes time and water, while under-cleaning leads to odor and stains.  

**Goal:** Build a system that **predicts the optimal wash timing** for each user’s cup using data and simple sensors.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- IoT-based hygiene monitoring exists for kitchens or appliances, but **not for personal items like mugs or tumblers**.  
- Most people underestimate how quickly bacteria multiply in warm, humid environments.  
- Personal hygiene tracking is trending — CupSense extends that trend into everyday life.

## 💡 Possible Features  
1. **Smart Sensor Tag**  
   - A small, attachable sensor measures temperature, humidity, and usage frequency.  
2. **AI Hygiene Model**  
   - Predicts contamination probability using beverage type, time elapsed, and environment.  
3. **Visual & Voice Alerts**  
   - “Hey, your mug’s been used for 9 hours since the last wash — time for a rinse!”  
4. **Usage Analytics Dashboard**  
   - Track weekly hygiene scores, compare usage patterns, and view bacteria-risk heatmaps.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- User logs (drink type, usage start/end time).  
- IoT sensor readings (temperature, humidity).  
- Public microbiology data on bacteria growth rates in beverages.  
- User feedback on smell or stain detection.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach  
1. **Data Collection** – Integrate user input + sensor readings.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract factors like beverage acidity, temperature cycles, and elapsed time.  
3. **Classification Model** – Train an ML model to classify “safe,” “warn,” and “must wash.”  
4. **User Interface** – Mobile app or smartwatch notifications with visualization.  

---

## 💡 Applications  
- **Personal Hygiene:** Maintain cleaner cups effortlessly.  
- **Workplace Use:** Shared mugs in offices can have automatic hygiene reminders.  
- **IoT Integration:** Connect with smart home systems for full automation.  
- **Research:** Study hygiene habits and bacterial risk patterns over time.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Prioritize **user convenience** — avoid intrusive alerts.  
- Ensure **privacy** for personal habit data.  
- Design for **low-cost and easy attachment** sensors.
