# 🧠 Project Title: Fit2Give — Weight Loss Meets Social Good

## 🔍 Summary
Fit2Give is a playful but meaningful system where users set **personal weight-loss goals**.  
If they succeed, they avoid donating; if they fail, a pre-set donation is automatically sent to a chosen charity.  
Either outcome creates value: **personal health improvement or social contribution**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Weight loss motivation often declines due to weak incentives.  
- Most apps focus on **tracking** (calories, weight logs) without accountability mechanisms.  
- A **“failure → donation”** model provides external motivation and creates positive social impact.  

**Goal:** Enhance commitment to weight-loss goals by integrating a self-imposed consequence that benefits charities.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Rooted in the concept of a **commitment device**: self-imposed rules boost success rates.  
- Psychological drivers:  
  - *Loss aversion*: “I don’t want to lose money.”  
  - *Reframing*: “Even if I fail, at least it supports a good cause.”  
- Can be extended to couples, friends, or community groups → turning fitness into a **shared social challenge**.

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Smart scale or health app logs (Fitbit, Apple Health, Samsung Health).  
- Food/activity tracking apps (MyFitnessPal, LoseIt).  
- Payment/charity APIs for donation automation.  
- Group challenge data (community success rates, social engagement).  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **App Integration**  
   - Connect user health data with donation/payment APIs.  
   - Countdown to goal deadline with real-time tracking.  

2. **Prediction & Adaptation**  
   - Use classification models to predict likelihood of success.  
   - Dynamically adjust donation stakes (higher risk = higher commitment).  

3. **Gamification**  
   - Badges, leaderboards, and group challenges.  
   - “Charity meter” showing potential impact.  

4. **Privacy & Security**  
   - Health data processed locally.  
   - Only donation trigger transmitted externally.

## ⚠️ Notes
