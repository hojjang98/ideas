# 🧠 Project Title: **Fit2Give: Weight Loss Meets Social Good**

## 🔍 Summary  
This project proposes a playful but meaningful system where users set personal weight-loss goals. If they succeed, they avoid making a donation; if they fail, a pre-set donation automatically goes to a chosen charity. Either outcome creates value: personal health improvement or social contribution.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Weight loss efforts often lose momentum due to weak incentives.  
- Current apps mainly focus on tracking (calories, weight logs) without strong accountability.  
- A **“failure → donation”** mechanism adds both personal motivation and social good.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Rooted in the concept of a **commitment device**, where self-imposed rules raise the chance of success.  
- Psychological drivers: “I don’t want to lose money” + “At least it supports a good cause.”  
- Couples, friends, or communities can set up group challenges, turning fitness into a social experience.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Weight logs from smart scales or health apps (Fitbit, Apple Health, Samsung Health)  
- Food and activity tracking apps (MyFitnessPal, LoseIt)  
- Charity APIs or online payment platforms for automated donations  
- Community challenge data (shared goals, group success rates)  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Connect user health data with donation/payment APIs  
- Classification model to predict likelihood of success → adjust donation size dynamically  
- Build mobile/web interface with countdown to goal deadline  
- Gamify with badges, leaderboards, and “charity meters”  
- Privacy-by-design: all health data stays on-device, only donation trigger is sent out  

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Stronger adherence to weight-loss or fitness goals  
- Novel combination of **self-improvement + philanthropy**  
- Engagement tool for fitness apps and charities alike  
- Fun way to turn private goals into socially meaningful challenges

- “Escape Hatch” feature: do an alternative task (e.g., 5 km run) to halve your penalty
