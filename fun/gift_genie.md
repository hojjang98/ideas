# 🧠 Project Title:  
**GiftGenie: Data-Driven Personalized Housewarming Gift Recommender**

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to provide **personalized housewarming gift recommendations** by leveraging demographic and lifestyle data, along with real-world gift satisfaction records. The goal is to ensure the gift not only suits the recipient’s profile but also has a high likelihood of being genuinely appreciated, reducing the guesswork and stress of gift selection.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Choosing a housewarming gift is often guided by generic advice or popular online rankings, which fail to account for individual preferences and living situations.  
Givers struggle to select gifts that are practical, safe (e.g., for households with pets), and well-received. There is a lack of data-driven recommendation systems tailored specifically for gift selection scenarios.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Gift-giving can strengthen relationships, but mismatched or impractical gifts often go unused.  
- Online marketplaces hold vast amounts of review data that, if analyzed properly, can reveal trends in gift satisfaction by demographic groups.  
- While recommendation systems are common in entertainment (movies, music, books), their application in the **gift domain** remains underdeveloped.  
- A targeted, data-informed system could significantly improve gift selection success rates.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- E-commerce product reviews and ratings (Amazon, Etsy, Coupang, etc.)  
- Social media mentions of housewarming gifts (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok)  
- User surveys on gift satisfaction, segmented by demographic factors  
- Lifestyle or household data (family size, presence of pets, housing type)  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **Data Collection**  
  - Scrape product reviews, filter for “gift” and “housewarming” mentions  
  - Conduct small-scale surveys to build a labeled satisfaction dataset  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Recipient profile: age, gender, household size, pet ownership, housing type  
  - Gift attributes: category (kitchenware, decor, appliances, consumables), price range, safety rating  

- **Recommendation Algorithms**  
  - Collaborative Filtering to find patterns among similar giver–recipient scenarios  
  - Content-Based Filtering to match gift attributes with recipient profiles  
  - Hybrid model combining both approaches  

- **User Interface**  
  - Simple quiz-style form for inputting recipient info  
  - Output: top N personalized gift suggestions with confidence scores and purchase links  

- **Feedback Loop**  
  - Allow users to rate the gift’s reception, feeding data back into the model for improvement
