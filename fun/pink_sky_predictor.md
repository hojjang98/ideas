# 🧠 Project Title: **Pink Sky Predictor: Forecasting Magical Evenings**

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to predict the likelihood of **pink-colored skies at sunset** based on atmospheric conditions, weather data, and air quality. The goal is to help people capture beautiful moments, plan outdoor activities, or simply enjoy an aesthetic evening walk.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Pink skies are breathtaking but highly unpredictable.  
- People often go outside expecting a colorful sunset, only to find cloudy or dull skies.  
- Travelers, photographers, and couples would benefit from a **data-driven "pink sky alert" system**.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Pink skies occur due to **sunlight scattering (Rayleigh, Mie scattering)** and atmospheric particle interaction.  
- Standard forecasts only mention sunset times, not sky colors.  
- Social media posts (#pinksky, #오늘하늘) spike dramatically on “beautiful sky” days → can be used as a data signal.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Meteorological data: humidity, cloud cover, temperature, precipitation  
- Air quality data: PM2.5, dust, pollution levels  
- Satellite imagery (NASA MODIS, Himawari)  
- Crowdsourced data: social media image posts with sunset hashtags  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **Classification model** predicting pink sky probability (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Multimodal approach: combine meteorological features with **image-based signals** from past sunsets.  
- Label training data by scraping social media images on dates with high "pink sky" mentions.  
- Build a web/app service showing **Pink Sky Index** and evening alerts.  

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Daily alerts for photographers, tourists, and outdoor lovers.  
- "Romantic evening probability" as a lifestyle app feature.  
- City-level pink sky frequency maps → useful for tourism marketing.  
- Novel meteorological insight into atmosphere–aesthetic relationships.

## 🤡 Bonus Features  
- **Pink Sky Index (0–100)**: Tokyo = 82 → high chance of Instagram-worthy sunset 🌇  
- Interactive heatmap of past pink skies by region.  
- A fun Kaggle-style challenge: *Pink Sky Prediction 2025*.
