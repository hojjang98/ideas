# 🧠 Project Title  
**Sunburn Simulator: Predicting Your Post-Sun Tan with AI**

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to build an interactive simulator that predicts how your skin might tan or burn under the current UV conditions. Based on user inputs like skin type, exposure time, clothing, and sunscreen usage, the simulator generates a visual preview of possible skin tone changes due to sun exposure.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Many people underestimate how quickly UV radiation can affect their skin. Despite high UV warnings, people often go outside without adequate protection. There is currently no intuitive tool that visualizes the *personalized* effect of sun exposure in a simple and engaging way.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Inspired by a recent trip to Fukuoka, Japan, where many locals showed noticeable tanning due to intense UV radiation.  
- Sparked the question: *“What if we could simulate how your skin might change after being in the sun for 30 minutes today?”*  
- Combines fun interaction with public health awareness, encouraging better sun safety practices.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- UV index from NASA or local meteorological agencies  
- Fitzpatrick skin type datasets for tone classification  
- Optional: image-based clothing coverage classifiers  
- Real-time geolocation and weather APIs

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Create a web-based input form: location, time, skin tone, clothing, sunscreen use  
- Calculate UV dosage from UV index and exposure time  
- Use rule-based logic or ML models to predict skin tone shift in HSV/RGB color space  
- (Optional) Apply simulated tone shift to uploaded face photo  
- Develop a demo app using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Helps users visualize the effects of sun exposure on their own skin  
- Promotes sunscreen use and sun-safe behavior  
- Could be extended into a mobile app or health awareness campaign  
- Great for portfolio demonstration in computer vision, health tech, or UX design
