# 🧠 Project Title: Sweat Forecast — Predicting Pit Stain Risk by Hour

## 🔍 Summary
Sweat Forecast is a system that predicts the likelihood of **visible underarm sweat stains** (“pit stains”) using weather, clothing, and activity data.  
It aims to help users make smarter wardrobe choices in hot, humid conditions — answering the critical question: *“Can I safely wear gray today?”*

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Pit stains are embarrassing in social and professional settings.  
- People rely on guesswork to choose clothing in summer.  
- Existing weather apps provide temperature and humidity but no **sweat visibility prediction**.  

**Goal:** Deliver a personalized “pit stain alert” system to guide daily clothing decisions.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Rising global temperatures and frequent heat waves.  
- Sweat visibility varies dramatically by fabric and color (gray ≫ black or white).  
- Inspired by online communities (Reddit, Korean forums) full of regret stories like “I shouldn’t have worn gray today.”  
- Highlights the need for **data-driven fashion guidance** in summer.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Hourly meteorological data: temperature, humidity, wind (national APIs).  
- Fabric/color sweat visibility studies (academic research, product specs).  
- Wearable activity data (Fitbit, Apple Health, step count, heart rate).  
- Crowdsourced data: user reports on sweat experiences.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Combine weather + activity + clothing info.  
   - Assign sweat-visibility weights by fabric and color.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM (temporal).  
   - Output = Pit Stain Risk Score (0–100).  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Hourly risk heatmaps (e.g., 2 PM = maximum danger).  
   - Shirt color recommendation system.  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Mobile/web interface showing daily sweat forecast.  
   - Push notifications for high-risk times.  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Wardrobe Assistant:** Quick “safe or not” guidance for wearing gray.  
- **Lifestyle App:** Daily pit-stain forecast with hourly risk scores.  
- **Advertising Opportunities:** Partner with deodorant brands or sportswear companies.  
- **Fun Data Science Project:** Fashion meets environmental analytics.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Sweat production varies individually; results are probabilistic, not absolute.  
- Requires robust data for clothing material × weather × activity interactions.  
- May need anonymized user reports to improve accuracy.
