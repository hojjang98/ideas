# 🧠 Project Title: Mapping Legal Smoking Zones in South Korea

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to visualize and analyze **legally designated smoking areas** across South Korea using GIS. It investigates the **gap between smoking restrictions and available legal zones**, with a focus on **urban accessibility** and **spatial justice** for smokers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
In many cities, “No Smoking” signs are ubiquitous—even on sidewalks or private business entrances. However, it is often unclear **where smokers are legally allowed to smoke**. Arbitrary or unofficial stickers create confusion and **lack of transparency**, making it difficult for smokers to comply with the law while maintaining basic access.

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- The number of non-smoking zones has increased rapidly since the 2010s  
- Government policies aim to reduce second-hand smoke but provide few legal alternatives  
- Smokers frequently report difficulty finding legal areas  
- There may be spatial bias: some neighborhoods might have **zero legal zones**  
- The project doesn't promote smoking, but rather aims to ensure **policy clarity and fairness**

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Seoul Open Data Plaza (서울시 열린데이터광장): public smoking area locations  
- Ministry of Environment / MOLIT geospatial datasets  
- Complaint data regarding smoking violations (e.g., 120 Dasan Call Center)  
- Government open data portals: legal non-smoking zone listings  
- Crawled map data from Kakao/Daum/Naver Maps (searching for 흡연구역)  
- Field survey or user-submitted data (for future crowdsourced mapping)

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- GIS visualization of legal smoking zones vs. non-smoking zones by density  
- Legal analysis of regional smoking policies and enforcement  
- Social media or community forum mining: smokers' feedback and experience  
- Optimization modeling: suggesting smoking zone locations based on traffic and population density

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Reveal **urban blind spots** where smoking is heavily restricted with no legal options  
- Create a prototype for a “Where to Smoke” location app or map  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for local governments  
- Facilitate better policy balance between non-smokers’ rights and smokers’ needs  
- Potential collaboration with urban planners or public health researchers

## ⚠️ Notes  
- This project does **not** promote smoking  
- Instead, it tackles **policy inconsistency**, transparency, and accessibility  
- Regional regulation differences (e.g., district-level laws) should be considered  
- Community-based mapping or citizen reporting could enhance scalability
