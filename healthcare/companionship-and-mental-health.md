# 🧠 Project Title: Companionship and Mental Health

## 🔍 Summary  
This project explores how non-human companionship—such as pets and generative AI (e.g., chatbots)—can affect mental health outcomes, particularly in individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, or social isolation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Loneliness and mental health issues are increasing, especially among single-person households and younger generations.  
Can alternative forms of companionship (e.g., pets, AI) provide emotional support and measurable mental health benefits?

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Some studies suggest that pet ownership may help reduce feelings of loneliness and stress, though evidence on its direct effect on depression and anxiety remains mixed.  
- Emerging evidence shows that AI companions like Replika, ChatGPT, or mental health apps (e.g., Woebot) are being used as emotional outlets.  

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Public health data: depression and anxiety rates (by age, gender, region)  
- Pet ownership statistics (e.g., number of dogs/cats per household)  
- App usage metrics for mental health or AI companions (if accessible)  
- Survey data or sentiment analysis from online communities

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Correlation analysis between pet ownership and mental health indicators  
- Sentiment analysis of social media/posts mentioning AI companions  
- Time series analysis to detect trends in AI usage vs. mental health incidents  
- Case studies or literature reviews on therapeutic roles of AI and animals

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Evidence supporting the psychological benefits of AI-based or animal companionship  
- Input for mental health policy or digital therapy tools  
- Foundations for building or evaluating AI companions tailored to emotional well-being

## 📝 Notes  
- Consider ethical implications of relying on AI for emotional support  
- Include generational differences in perception of “companionship”  
- Opportunity to collaborate with psychology researchers or human-computer interaction specialists
