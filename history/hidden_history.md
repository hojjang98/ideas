# 🧠 Project Title: Hidden History — Daily Dose of Unknown Facts

## 🔍 Summary  
This project delivers **lesser-known historical facts** and **hidden personal stories** about famous figures or events on a daily basis. Instead of highlighting only major events (wars, treaties, elections), it uncovers **human details** such as failures, habits, or side jobs that shaped history.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Most “On This Day in History” services focus on well-known events.  
However, what truly engages people is the **unexpected human side of history**:  
- Lincoln once worked as a postmaster  
- Einstein relied on long walks for inspiration  
- Great artists had “failed” works before their masterpieces  

Without this dimension, history often feels distant and abstract, missing its potential to inspire **personal growth**.  

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Books like Dale Carnegie’s *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living* highlight historical figures’ **inner struggles and growth**  
- Discovering hidden stories provides **inspiration and relatability** (“Even Lincoln failed before becoming president”)  
- Lesser-known facts enrich education by showing history not as static events, but as a **living narrative of people**  

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Wikipedia “Did you know?” archives  
- Biography databases (e.g., Britannica, Biography.com)  
- History Today / OnThisDay APIs  
- Digital history projects from universities  
- Memoirs, letters, or speeches (digitized collections)  

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Daily fact generation with LLMs (summarize, verify, reframe for accessibility)  
- Categorize by type: jobs, habits, failures, turning points, small events with big consequences  
- Visualization: timeline of “hidden” vs. “known” history  
- Reflection prompts: *“What can we learn from this fact today?”*  

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Make history **more relatable** through storytelling  
- Help readers see that greatness often emerges from **failure and small choices**  
- Provide daily micro-doses of **self-growth inspiration**  
- Gamify with quizzes: *“Did you know this about Lincoln?”*  
- Support themed weeks (e.g., “Scientists’ Habits,” “Leaders’ Failures”)  

## ⚠️ Notes  
- This project does **not** attempt to rewrite history, but to highlight **less-discussed aspects**  
- Requires careful source verification to avoid myths or urban legends  
- Should maintain a tone of **curiosity and growth**, not gossip
