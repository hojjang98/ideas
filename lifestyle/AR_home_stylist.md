# üß† Project Title: AR Home Stylist ‚Äî Augmented Reality Interior Planner

## üîç Summary
This project develops an **AR-based interior planning system** that lets users virtually place furniture and d√©cor items in their rooms.  
It emphasizes **personalization beyond big-brand catalogs**, supports **small/local shops**, and provides **AI-based style recommendations** to differentiate from existing solutions.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement
- Current AR interior apps (e.g., IKEA Place, Houzz) focus mainly on **large furniture retailers**.  
- Hobbyists and everyday users lack tools to test **smaller items** (vases, lamps, cushions) or **custom/local products**.  
- Many people find it hard to visualize whether an item will fit harmoniously with their existing furniture.  

**Goal:** Build a system that combines **AI-driven suggestions** and **AR visualization** for both small and large interior items.

---

## üìö Background & Motivation
- Interior decoration has become a popular lifestyle hobby, especially for home caf√©s, DIY setups, and small apartments.  
- Online shopping often leads to **returns** due to mismatch between product images and real space.  
- Small/local furniture stores usually lack advanced AR visualization tools.  
- A system that democratizes AR interior planning could **empower individuals and small businesses** alike.  

---

## üìä Potential Data Sources
- Furniture and interior product catalogs (open APIs, online shops).  
- Crowdsourced photos of user-decorated rooms.  
- Open datasets on room layouts and floor plans.  
- Community-driven uploads (users adding their own items for AR simulation).  

---

## üß™ Technical Approach
1. **AR Visualization**  
   - Room scanning with phone camera.  
   - Virtual placement of items (scaling, rotation, material simulation).  

2. **AI Style Recommendation**  
   - Analyze room colors, textures, and furniture styles.  
   - Suggest matching products (e.g., ‚Äúwood tones + minimalist cushions‚Äù).  

3. **Community Layer**  
   - Users share their own AR-decorated setups.  
   - Voting/feedback system for popular styles.  

4. **Small-Shop Integration**  
   - API or manual product registration for local/interior shops.  
   - Support indie designers and sustainable furniture brands.

## üí° Applications
- Help users test items before purchasing ‚Üí reduce returns.  
- Provide **AI-driven mood-based suggestions** (cozy, minimal, vintage, etc.).  
- Offer small shops an easy AR showcase tool.  
- Enable communities to share and remix interior inspirations.  
- Educational use: interior design students experimenting virtually.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Differentiation from IKEA/Houzz: focus on **smaller items, indie/local brands, AI personalization, and community features**.  
- Requires device compatibility (ARKit/ARCore).  
- Privacy consideration: room scanning data must be stored securely.

## üîó Related Inspirations
- IKEA Place (limited to IKEA catalog).  
- Houzz (catalog-based AR).  
- Wayfair (AR shopping).  
- Pinterest Room Decor boards (non-AR inspiration).
