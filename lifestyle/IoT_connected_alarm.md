# 🧠 Project Title: Smart Wake Mat — IoT-Connected Alarm & Health Tracker  

## 🔍 Summary  
Smart Wake Mat is an **IoT-enabled alarm mat** that requires users to physically step on it to stop the alarm.  
Unlike existing pressure-based alarm mats, it integrates with **smart home devices** and includes **health tracking features** like weight measurement, making waking up both effective and productive.  

---  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Traditional alarms are too easy to snooze, leading to oversleeping.  
- Existing alarm mats only stop when stepped on, but offer **no added value** beyond waking up.  
- Morning routines involve multiple separate tasks (alarm, lights, coffee, weighing) with **no integrated solution**.  

**Goal:** Transform the alarm mat into a **smart morning coach** that automates routines and provides health insights.  

---  

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Many people struggle with **consistent wake-up habits**.  
- Smart home devices are common, but wake-up routines rarely leverage them.  
- Fitness enthusiasts often weigh themselves in the morning, but this requires a **separate device**.  

---  

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- User’s wake-up times and standing duration.  
- IoT device activity logs (lights, blinds, coffee machines).  
- Health tracking apps (Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit).  
- Daily/weekly weight logs.  

---  

## 🧪 Technical Approach  
1. **Pressure Sensor System**  
   - Detects standing for ≥ 5 seconds to stop alarm.  

2. **IoT Integration Layer**  
   - Connects with smart lights, blinds, thermostat, and coffee machines.  

3. **Health Tracking**  
   - Built-in scale for weight and BMI estimation.  
   - Syncs with fitness tracking apps.  

4. **Analytics & Feedback**  
   - Reports on wake-up consistency, average wake time, and health metrics.  

5. **Gamification**  
   - Points and streaks for successful wake-ups.  
   - Optional challenges (e.g., “7-day streak unlocks reward”).  

---  

## 💡 Applications  
- **Smart alarm system** for individuals struggling with snoozing.  
- **Morning routine automation** for smart homes.  
- **Health tracker** that simplifies weight logging.  
- **Wellness platform** that combines sleep hygiene and fitness insights.  

---  

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Must ensure **privacy & data security** for weight and health logs.  
- Hardware durability is critical (daily weight measurement).  
- Needs balance between **strictness (alarm won’t snooze)** and **usability (avoiding frustration)**.

- Ruggie Alarm Clock (pressure-based alarm mat).  
- Smart scales (Withings, Xiaomi).  
- IoT morning routines (Google Home, Alexa).  
- Habit tracking apps with gamification.
