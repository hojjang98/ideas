# 🧠 Project Title: **BirdGuard — Smart Anti-Peck Trash Bag**

## 🔍 Summary  
**BirdGuard** is an eco-friendly smart trash bag designed to **prevent birds and stray animals** from tearing garbage apart.  
By combining **odor-masking layers, color-based deterrents, and harmless acoustic responses**, BirdGuard protects urban hygiene without harming wildlife.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- In many urban and residential areas, **crows, magpies, and pigeons** rip open trash bags to find food.  
- This leads to **littering, odor, and increased sanitation costs**.  
- Existing countermeasures (nets, heavy lids, or cages) are **inconvenient and not scalable**.

**Goal:** Develop a **non-lethal, eco-friendly, and smart deterrent trash bag** that prevents scavenging while maintaining environmental safety.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Birds such as crows and magpies have **highly developed visual and olfactory senses**, responding strongly to certain colors and smells.  
- Their scavenging behavior impacts **urban cleanliness and citizen satisfaction**.  
- Studies show that up to **20% of city cleaning costs** can be related to animal-induced waste scattering.  
- BirdGuard aims to become a **“coexistence-based urban hygiene solution”**, protecting both humans and wildlife.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **Municipal sanitation data** (waste collection frequency, animal-related complaints)  
- **Ornithological behavior datasets** (visual & olfactory response studies)  
- **Environmental sensor data** (temperature, humidity, odor concentration)

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach  

1. **Odor Control Layer**  
   - Multi-layer film that traps volatile organic compounds (VOCs)  
   - Embedded microcapsules with natural essential oils to neutralize protein/fat scents

2. **Visual Deterrent Design**  
   - Apply colors and reflective tones that birds instinctively avoid (e.g., metallic blue)  
   - Integrate subtle “eye patterns” or shimmer effects to mimic predator cues

3. **Acoustic Strip (Optional)**  
   - Ultrasonic microstrip activated by pecking pressure  
   - Solar-powered and low-energy, emitting non-harmful tones inaudible to humans

4. **Eco-Safe Material**  
   - Made from **corn-based biodegradable plastic**  
   - Fully compatible with existing municipal disposal systems

---

## 💡 Applications  
- Municipal smart waste management projects  
- Apartment complexes, public parks, restaurant disposal areas  
- Eco-innovation campaigns and smart city initiatives

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Requires **durability testing** under wind and rain  
- Sensitivity tuning needed for **different bird species**  
- If electronics are included, **recyclability** must be considered
