# 🧠 Project Title: Community Choice Market — Resident-Driven Food Truck Selection  

## 🔍 Summary  
Community Choice Market is a **resident-driven system** that brings desired food trucks or mobile vendors into apartment complexes.  
Instead of relying solely on pre-arranged contracts, residents **vote, suggest, and pre-order** to ensure that trucks reflect actual community demand, leading to higher satisfaction and sales.  

---  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Current contracts bring trucks regardless of **resident preferences**, leading to poor sales.  
- Residents often feel disconnected: *“This isn’t the food I wanted.”*  
- Vendors risk wasted effort if demand is low.  

**Goal:** Create a **hybrid model** that preserves existing contracts while introducing **resident participation (voting + pre-orders)** to match supply with demand.  

---  

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Apartment complexes already serve as mini-communities with shared spaces.  
- Mobile vendors are convenient but often misaligned with residents’ tastes.  
- People are more willing to buy when they feel they **chose** the vendor.  
- A system balancing **contract stability** and **resident choice** can increase trust and engagement.  

---  

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Resident voting results.  
- Pre-order/advance booking data.  
- Vendor sales records.  
- Feedback surveys from residents and vendors.  

---  

## 🧪 Technical Approach  
1. **Resident Engagement**  
   - Online voting system integrated with apartment apps.  
   - Suggestion box for new vendor types.  

2. **Demand Assurance**  
   - Pre-orders required to confirm a truck visit.  
   - Minimum threshold (e.g., 20 pre-orders) secures vendor participation.  

3. **Hybrid Scheduling**  
   - Fixed slots reserved for existing contract vendors.  
   - Open slots filled by resident-selected vendors.  

4. **Analytics & Feedback**  
   - Track sales, participation, and satisfaction rates.  
   - Provide vendors with insights into preferred products and time slots.  

---  

## 💡 Applications  
- **Residents:** Access to food/services they actually want.  
- **Vendors:** Reduced risk, guaranteed demand.  
- **Management:** Transparent, fair system balancing contracts and choice.  
- **Community Building:** Shared events and excitement around chosen vendors.  

---  

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Must respect **existing contracts**; transition via hybrid model.  
- Requires transparent communication with both residents and vendors.  
- Voting and pre-orders should be simple and accessible.
