# 🧠 Project Title: MoodLens — AI-based Outfit & Color Recommender

## 🔍 Summary
This project develops an **AI-powered outfit and color recommendation system** that considers a user’s **mood, daily schedule, and weather conditions**.  
It leverages **color psychology** and **personalized fashion guidance** to help users choose outfits that match both their emotions and practical needs.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Existing fashion apps mostly provide **generic outfit suggestions** or **retailer-driven catalogs**.  
- Users struggle to decide what to wear in the morning, often wasting time.  
- Current systems rarely account for **psychological states** or **contextual situations** (e.g., “important presentation,” “first date”).  

**Goal:** Build a system that combines **mood tracking, context awareness, and AI-driven fashion advice** to give users confidence in their daily outfit choices.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Colors influence mood and perception (blue → calm, red → energetic, green → balanced).  
- People want outfits that not only look good but also **boost confidence and match social situations**.  
- Many users desire a tool that goes beyond simple weather-based suggestions to **integrate mood and events**.  
- Inspiration came from the difficulty of choosing the right outfit when anxious or preparing for special occasions.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Weather APIs (temperature, humidity, rain forecasts).  
- User mood/schedule logs (manual input).  
- Public datasets on color psychology and fashion styles.  
- Crowdsourced outfit photos and user feedback.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Mood & Context Input**  
   - Users log their current mood and daily events.  
   - System integrates with calendar apps for context.

2. **AI Color & Outfit Recommendation**  
   - Use color psychology + style matching models.  
   - Suggest palettes and outfit combinations aligned with mood and situation.

3. **Weather & Practical Layer**  
   - Adjust recommendations based on temperature and weather forecasts.  
   - Ensure practicality (e.g., no light fabrics in heavy rain).

4. **Personalization & Community**  
   - AI learns from user feedback to refine suggestions.  
   - Community sharing of outfits and color palettes for inspiration.

## 💡 Applications
- Morning decision support: “What should I wear today?”  
- Event-based recommendations: interviews, dates, or casual outings.  
- Mood-based visualization: track how outfits influence emotional well-being.  
- Support for personal stylists and fashion coaches.  
- Potential integration with AR mirrors for real-time try-ons.

## ⚠️ Notes
- Differentiation: unlike typical outfit apps, **MoodLens integrates mood, events, and color psychology**.  
- Challenges: accurate mood recognition depends on user input.  
- Privacy considerations: mood and schedule data must be securely stored.
