# 🧠 Project Title: **Pants First — AI Fashion Recommender**

## 🔍 Summary  
**Pants First** flips the usual fashion routine by starting with what you actually wear most: your pants.  
Instead of picking a shirt and then matching bottoms, this system generates **full outfit recommendations based on your chosen pants**, considering **style, weather, and occasion**.  
It helps people with limited wardrobes or indecisive mornings to find creative and stylish looks.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Most outfit recommendation systems assume the **top is chosen first**, ignoring how many people choose pants first.  
- Limited wardrobe variety (e.g., only a few jeans/slacks) often leads to **repetitive or boring looks**.  
- Current tools focus on online catalog matching, not **what’s already in your closet**.  

**Goal:** Build a **pants-centered AI stylist** that helps users maximize outfit variety and confidence.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- People often buy or own fewer pants than tops, making them the **anchor piece** of daily outfits.  
- Existing AR try-on apps (e.g., IKEA Place for furniture, or fashion marketplaces) don’t emphasize **closet-first personalization**.  
- A bottom-up approach makes sense for everyday decision-making and helps users **rediscover items they already own**.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- User’s uploaded closet photos (pants + tops + shoes).  
- Fashion lookbooks and OOTD (Outfit of the Day) data.  
- Weather APIs (temperature, rain, seasonality).  
- Social media fashion trends (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok).

## 🧪 Technical Approach  
1. **Pants Recognition**  
   - Use CV models to classify pants type (jeans, slacks, joggers, shorts) and color.  

2. **Style Profiling**  
   - Learn user’s preferred fashion vibe (casual, formal, street, sporty).  

3. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - Match pants with suitable tops/shoes/accessories based on embeddings + rules.  
   - Consider constraints: weather, occasion, color harmony.  

4. **AR Visualization**  
   - Let users preview combinations in AR before wearing.  

5. **Community Layer**  
   - “Show me how others styled similar pants” → collaborative inspiration.  

---

## 💡 Applications  
- **Daily outfit planner** for people with few pants but many tops.  
- **Wardrobe maximizer** that stretches existing clothing into new looks.  
- **Shopping assistant**: recommend missing items that complete looks for a given pant.  
- **Fashion community** where users share “pants-first” outfit ideas.

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Privacy concerns when analyzing personal closet photos.  
- Needs high accuracy in color/fabric detection to avoid mismatched looks.  
- Avoid repetitive recommendations by injecting diversity.
