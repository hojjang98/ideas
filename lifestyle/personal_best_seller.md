# 🧠 Project Title: Personal Bestseller — Your Own Book Ranking  

## 🔍 Summary  
Personal Bestseller reimagines the concept of **bestseller lists** by creating a **personalized ranking** of books.  
Instead of showing what sold the most, it curates a chart based on **your unique taste, reading history, and trusted reviews**, helping readers avoid hype-driven disappointments and discover books that truly fit them.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Traditional bestseller lists reflect **sales volume**, not actual quality or personal fit.  
- Readers often buy books because they’re labeled “bestseller,” only to find them **underwhelming**.  
- There is no system that adjusts rankings to match **individual reading preferences**.  

**Goal:** Replace one-size-fits-all bestseller charts with a **dynamic, personal bestseller list** tailored to each reader.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Platforms like Netflix/Spotify already provide **personalized recommendations**, but the book industry still relies on **universal top 10 lists**.  
- Choosing books involves **time and money investment**, making mismatched purchases frustrating.  
- A personal bestseller chart reduces **decision fatigue** and encourages **sustainable reading habits**.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- User’s reading history (purchased, finished, dropped).  
- Book review platforms (Goodreads, Yes24, 교보문고 등).  
- Social reading communities & personal annotations.  
- NLP analysis of book descriptions and reader reviews.

## 🧪 Technical Approach  
1. **User Profiling**  
   - Analyze user’s genre/author preferences and reading style.  

2. **Book Embeddings**  
   - Use NLP to embed book descriptions and reviews into a preference space.  

3. **Ranking Algorithm**  
   - Blend global popularity with personal fit → produce a re-ordered “bestseller” list.  

4. **Explanatory Layer**  
   - Show *why* a book is ranked high (e.g., “similar to X you loved, but lighter in tone”).  

5. **Community Personalization**  
   - Add a “Readers Like You” bestseller list from similar profiles.  

---

## 💡 Applications  
- **Personalized Bestseller Chart** on bookstore apps.  
- **Book discovery tool** for casual readers overwhelmed by hype.  
- **Community lens**: compare mass-market vs. niche “best for me” rankings.  
- **Library or school systems** recommending books that fit student profiles.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Must handle privacy concerns when analyzing personal reading data.  
- Avoid overfitting to narrow tastes → occasionally inject diversity.  
- Needs balance between **exploration (new books)** and **exploitation (familiar favorites)**.
