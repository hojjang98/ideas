# 🧠 Project Title: TrueETA+ — Region-Based Real-Time Delivery Time Predictor  

## 🔍 Summary  
TrueETA+ transforms vague delivery promises like “2–3 days” into **data-driven, location-specific delivery predictions**.  
By aggregating real-world shipping data across regions and carriers, it provides users with **precise delivery time estimates**—down to the hour—for their exact location.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Most e-commerce platforms only show **broad estimates** (“usually ships in 2–3 days”), which vary widely by region and carrier.  
- Customers often experience **unexpected delays** because these averages ignore **actual delivery patterns**.  
- There is no transparent system that predicts **true delivery times by area**.  

**Goal:** Build a system that predicts **when an item will actually arrive** based on regional delivery history, carrier efficiency, and real-time conditions.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- As online shopping grows, **delivery transparency** has become a major factor in customer trust.  
- Logistics companies have internal ETA prediction models, but end-users rarely see **fine-grained data**.  
- Even a one-day mismatch (e.g., birthday gift arriving early or late) can significantly impact user satisfaction.  
- By offering **real ETA visibility**, TrueETA+ improves user experience and supports smarter purchasing decisions.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **Public logistics datasets** (e.g., Korea Post, CJ Logistics, Hanjin Shipping).  
- **Anonymized delivery tracking records** (sender–receiver regions, timestamps).  
- **E-commerce reviews & user feedback** mentioning delivery speed (“arrived next day”, “took 3 days”).  
- **Regional metadata**: postal codes, distances, weather, holidays, and traffic conditions.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach  

1. **Data Aggregation & Preprocessing**  
   - Collect and anonymize sender–receiver address pairs.  
   - Convert addresses to **geo-coordinates** and cluster by region (e.g., DBSCAN or K-Means).  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract time-based features (weekday, time of order).  
   - Add environmental variables (weather, holidays, urban density).  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Train a **hybrid regression–time series model** (LightGBM + Prophet) for ETA prediction.  
   - Output probabilistic delivery windows (e.g., *expected: 27h ± 2.3h*).  

4. **Real-Time Adjustment**  
   - Incorporate live logistics status and traffic data for continuous ETA updates.  

5. **Visualization & UX**  
   - Show **map-based delivery speed heatmaps** and **timeline charts** (e.g., “expected arrival 14:30–17:00”).

## 💡 Applications  
- E-commerce checkout pages → *“Order within 2 hours to receive by Thursday 6 PM (92% confidence)”*  
- Logistics dashboards for **regional performance monitoring**.  
- **Customer trust index** comparing carriers or regions.  
- Urban policy insights on **last-mile delivery bottlenecks**.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- Must anonymize address data to prevent privacy risks.  
- Balance between **accuracy** and **over-personalization** — focus on area-level, not individual tracking.  
- Consider **data bias**: urban vs. rural regions, carrier differences, and weather variability.
