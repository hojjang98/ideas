# 🧠 Project Title: **Footprint Navigator**
> *Your digital traces, turned into personal insights.*

---

## 🔍 Summary  
Footprint Navigator is an AI-powered platform that analyzes a user's digital footprint — browsing patterns, SNS behavior, email habits, and app usage — to provide both security insights and lifestyle coaching. It transforms raw digital traces into a clear understanding of one’s behavior, risk patterns, and emotional usage tendencies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Users lack visibility into their own digital usage patterns.  
- Emotional browsing and risky behaviors (weak passwords, phishing tendencies, late-night doomscrolling) often go unnoticed.  
- Existing tools focus on productivity *or* security, not both.

**Goal:** Build a unified system that reveals patterns, reduces risk, and improves digital well-being.

---

## 💡 Key Objectives  
1. Automatically extract behavior, emotion, and security signals from digital traces.  
2. Provide weekly summaries with actionable insights.  
3. Deliver personalized coaching for healthier and safer digital habits.
