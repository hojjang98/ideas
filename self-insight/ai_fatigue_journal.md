# 🧠 Project Title: **AI Fatigue Journal — Emotional & Fatigue Insight Tracker**

## 🔍 Summary  
This project uses **natural language processing** to analyze daily journal entries, identifying patterns of **fatigue, stress, and emotional fluctuation**.  
It provides users with **personalized insights** and visual feedback based on their self-written text.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
People often say “I’m so tired” — but don’t know **why**.  
Even if they write a journal, it's hard to track fatigue patterns or emotional trends over time without help.  
→ Can we use NLP to **translate raw journaling into structured insights**?

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- You already write journals — that’s rich, personal data  
- Emotional states and fatigue levels fluctuate subtly and cyclically  
- GPT-like models can interpret **contextual clues in natural language**  
- A tool that highlights your **hidden emotional habits** can be both therapeutic and insightful  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Your own daily journal entries (text only)  
- Optional: sleep tracking, caffeine intake, calendar events  
- (Optional) Labeling 1–5 fatigue level manually for fine-tuning

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Use a sentiment/fatigue classifier (fine-tuned or zero-shot) to extract:
  - Fatigue indicators ("exhausted", "drained", "foggy", "wired", etc.)
  - Emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative)
- Use keyword extraction & clustering to find repeated stressors
- Visualize:
  - Fatigue trend over time (line graph)
  - Common emotional triggers (word cloud or bubble chart)
  - “This week you wrote ‘tired’ 6 times — mostly on workdays.”

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Personal fatigue & stress dashboard  
- Smart suggestions: “You’re usually tired after meetings — consider breaks”  
- Long-term self-awareness → improve health habits  
- Could be extended into a therapeutic chatbot for reflection

---

## 🛠️ Tools / Stack  
- Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Streamlit (for interface)  
- NLP libraries: spaCy, NLTK, or LLM APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)  
- Data visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
