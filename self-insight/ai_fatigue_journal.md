# 🧠 Project Title: AI Fatigue Journal — Emotional & Fatigue Insight Tracker

## 🔍 Summary
AI Fatigue Journal is a tool that uses **natural language processing (NLP)** to analyze daily journal entries.  
It identifies patterns of **fatigue, stress, and emotional fluctuation**, providing users with **personalized insights** and visual feedback based on their own writing.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- People frequently say *“I’m tired”* but rarely know **why**.  
- Journals capture rich emotional data, but it’s hard to track fatigue or mood trends manually.  
- Without structured feedback, hidden emotional habits remain unnoticed.  

**Goal:** Translate free-form journaling into structured insights that highlight **fatigue patterns, emotional triggers, and long-term trends**.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Journals provide **personal, context-rich data** for self-reflection.  
- Emotional states and fatigue fluctuate cyclically, influenced by habits, work, and lifestyle.  
- Advances in GPT-like models enable contextual understanding of subtle language cues.  
- A fatigue-aware journal assistant could be both **therapeutic and insightful**.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- User’s daily journal entries (text).  
- Optional: sleep tracking, caffeine intake, and calendar events.  
- (Optional) Manual fatigue-level labels (1–5) for fine-tuning.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Text Analysis**  
   - Sentiment/fatigue classification (zero-shot or fine-tuned).  
   - Detect fatigue expressions (“exhausted,” “foggy,” “wired”).  

2. **Keyword Extraction**  
   - Identify recurring stressors or emotional triggers.  
   - Cluster keywords into themes (work, relationships, health).  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Fatigue trend lines over time.  
   - Word clouds or bubble charts of frequent triggers.  
   - Weekly summaries: *“You wrote ‘tired’ 6 times — mostly after meetings.”*  

4. **Interface**  
   - Streamlit dashboard with charts and text feedback.  
   - Privacy-first design (local storage or encryption).  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Self-Tracking:** Personal fatigue and stress dashboards.  
- **Wellness Suggestions:** Insights like *“You’re usually tired after meetings — try short breaks.”*  
- **Therapeutic Use:** Aid self-reflection and emotional awareness.  
- **Extension:** Can evolve into a chatbot companion for guided reflection.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Journals are sensitive; **data privacy and encryption are essential**.  
- Fatigue detection is approximate → should be positioned as guidance, not diagnosis.  
- Requires user consistency in journaling for reliable insights.
