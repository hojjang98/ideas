# 🧠 Project Title: Habit Time Capsule — Data-Driven Future Self Simulator

## 🔍 Summary
Habit Time Capsule is a tool that lets users **log daily habits** and run **data-driven simulations** showing how those habits compound over time (1/3/6/12 months).  
Unlike chat-based “future self” apps, it emphasizes **quantitative forecasts, counterfactuals, and shareable infographics**, making long-term change tangible.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- People struggle to see how daily habits add up into meaningful outcomes.  
- Existing habit apps focus on streaks but lack **forecasts** or **what-if scenarios**.  
- Without future visualization, motivation often fades.  

**Goal:** Provide habit tracking plus **quantitative forecasting** to help users understand the impact of small daily choices.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Inspired by the idea of a **time capsule** for habits, merging journaling with simulation.  
- Small tweaks (e.g., +10 min/day study, +1,000 KRW savings) can lead to big changes, but users rarely see this clearly.  
- A system that **projects trajectories and counterfactuals** can boost motivation and self-awareness.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- User input: daily habit logs (study hours, workout effort, sleep, savings).  
- Domain models: fitness, finance, study, sleep datasets.  
- Optional integrations: health trackers, finance apps, study tools.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Habit Logging & Analytics**  
   - Quick input (toggle, slider, text, voice).  
   - Auto-tagging by domain (Fitness, Study, Finance, Sleep).  
   - “Trajectory Meter” to visualize daily momentum.  

2. **Forecast Engine**  
   - Domain-specific models for fitness (1RM, VO₂max), study (hours, retention), finance (savings growth), and sleep (efficiency).  
   - Forecasts with confidence intervals and milestone predictions.  

3. **Counterfactuals & What-If Analysis**  
   - Side-by-side scenarios: maintain vs. +10% effort vs. −20% drop.  
   - Feature importance to highlight key drivers of change.  
   - Weekly alerts on tipping points for habit tweaks.  

4. **Time-Capsule Playback**  
   - Record a note (text/voice/video) for the future self.  
   - On unlock, overlay predictions vs. actual progress.  
   - Highlight reel of key milestones.  

5. **Infographic Reports**  
   - Monthly auto-generated infographics/PDFs with trends and nudges.  
   - Privacy-safe, sharable visuals for accountability.

## 💡 Applications
- **Personal Growth:** Reinforce motivation by visualizing habit impact.  
- **Education:** Help learners see cumulative study progress.  
- **Fitness & Health:** Quantify outcomes beyond streak tracking.  
- **Finance:** Show how micro-savings compound into milestones.  
- **Wellness Tools:** Merge journaling, forecasting, and reflection.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Accuracy depends on domain models and input quality.  
- Requires clear messaging: forecasts are **estimates, not guarantees**.  
- Privacy must be prioritized for personal logs.
