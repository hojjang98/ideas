# 🧠 Project Title: Anti-Algorithm — Breaking the Recommendation Loop

## 🔍 Summary
Anti-Algorithm is a recommendation framework designed to **break echo chambers** by injecting controlled diversity into user feeds.  
Instead of reinforcing existing preferences, it counterbalances content history with **opposite or underexposed categories**, encouraging **broader discovery** and healthier digital experiences.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Modern platforms over-optimize personalization, creating **preference bubbles**.  
- This narrows exposure, reinforces biases, and limits cultural, political, and emotional diversity.  
- Current recommender systems lack mechanisms to **actively counterbalance user bias** with structured diversity.  

**Goal:** Develop a recommendation system that balances accuracy with **meaningful diversity injection**.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Echo chambers and filter bubbles are widely documented in recommender research [1][5][6].  
- Concerns include reinforcing **social/political division** and reducing **cultural exploration**.  
- Many users express fatigue: *“I keep getting the same kind of content — my tastes feel stuck.”*  
- A system that provides **serendipity without chaos** could restore variety and satisfaction.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Platform consumption logs (music, video, news).  
- Public APIs (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter).  
- Academic datasets (MovieLens for prototyping).  
- User surveys: perceived novelty, diversity, satisfaction.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Hybrid Recommender with Diversity Control**  
   - Combine collaborative filtering (CF) + content-based filtering (CBF).  
   - Add a **“heat-spreading” / noise injection layer** to boost underexposed items [2].  

2. **Neutrality Score Modeling**  
   - Map items along genre, emotion, or ideology axes.  
   - Quantify imbalance to guide counterbalancing.  

3. **Post-Hoc Diversity Balancing**  
   - Apply graph-based methods like **FairMatch** to re-rank for aggregate diversity [3].  

4. **Temporal Diversity Optimization**  
   - Ensure variation across sessions/days, not just one-off novelty [4].  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Music Streaming:** “1-hour random genre” mode balancing favorites with new sounds.  
- **Video/News:** Toggle for “opposite spectrum” or “beyond your bubble.”  
- **Visualization:** Heatmaps comparing user content distribution vs. global distribution.  
- **Scalable Use:** Extendable to music, video, news, or social feeds.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Aim is **balancing, not overriding** user preferences.  
- Ethical guardrails needed to avoid surfacing harmful content.  
- Cultural/political sensitivity must be respected when injecting diversity.
