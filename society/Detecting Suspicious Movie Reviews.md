# 🧠 Project Title  
**Trust or Trick? Detecting Suspicious Movie Reviews through Behavioral Signals**

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to detect suspicious or potentially manipulative movie reviews by analyzing discrepancies between star ratings and review content. By combining natural language processing with user behavior metadata, it identifies reviews that may be artificially inflated or promotional, helping consumers make more informed decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Moviegoers are often misled by overly positive reviews that don't match their experience. Many reviews may be written for promotional purposes, creating a distorted perception of a film’s quality. Traditional review aggregators rely on star ratings and unverified user input, lacking tools to detect or flag these inconsistencies.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Inspired by a personal experience: a boring film had an unusually high number of glowing reviews, despite having many low ratings.  
- Raised suspicion that some reviews were promotional or manipulated.  
- Consumers often rely on reviews, making this a trust and transparency issue in digital society.  
- Similar problems exist in other domains (e.g., products, restaurants), but films are emotionally sensitive and reputation-driven.

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Naver Movie Review Dataset (네이버 영화 리뷰 감성 데이터)  
- IMDb reviews or Rotten Tomatoes scraped data  
- Public sentiment-labeled review datasets (e.g., AIHub, Kaggle)  
- User metadata: review count, account age, review timing  
- Optional: manually labeled examples of verified vs. suspicious reviews

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Sentiment analysis vs. star rating inconsistency detection  
- Repetition or overuse of promotional keywords (e.g., “masterpiece”, “must-watch”)  
- Clustering reviews by similarity and time (bot bursts or paid campaigns)  
- User behavior profiling (reviewing only 1 film, too many 5-stars, etc.)  
- Trustworthiness scoring model using Random Forest, LightGBM, or transformer models  
- Visualization: heatmap of review consistency, network graph of review clusters

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Reveal which movies have high proportions of suspicious or inconsistent reviews  
- Help consumers quickly identify which reviews are likely genuine  
- Provide tools for platforms to moderate or weight reviews differently  
- Expandable to other sectors (e-commerce, restaurant, books)

---

## ⚠️ Notes  
- This is **not** a censorship tool; it only aids in transparency  
- Privacy of reviewers must be respected — no personal information tracked  
- Requires caution in labeling “suspicious” reviews (risk of false positives)  
- Crowdsourced validation could improve model reliability
