# 🧠 Project Title:  
**Seoul Youth Footprint: Mapping Young Mobility for Smarter Urban Policy**

## 🔍 Summary  
This project leverages vehicle ownership data and voluntary location tracking among young people in Seoul to identify popular destinations and design targeted youth programs. It aims to support data-driven urban planning that reflects real behavioral patterns.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Current youth-related policies often rely on demographic data rather than behavioral data, leading to mismatches between public services and actual youth interests or movement patterns. There's a lack of real-time or location-based insight into where young people actually spend their time.

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Seoul’s youth population is mobile, diverse in lifestyle, and often underrepresented in place-based policy decisions.  
- The idea was triggered by public vehicle ownership statistics, which revealed that many young people in Seoul own or use cars.  
- Young residents often frequent hidden local spots or emerging areas not traditionally considered by policymakers.  
- Understanding their mobility patterns can help rebalance public resources and empower youth-oriented initiatives.

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Seoul Metropolitan Government’s youth vehicle ownership statistics (공공데이터포털)  
- Population and district-level youth demographics (KOSIS, 서울열린데이터광장)  
- Voluntary location tracking via smartphone apps (consent-based GPS logging)  
- Public Points of Interest (POI) databases  
- Event or footfall datasets (optional: telecom or card usage data with privacy considerations)

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- Clustering analysis (e.g., DBSCAN, KMeans) to detect youth hotspot areas  
- Time-based movement pattern modeling  
- POI tagging to understand type of locations visited (cafes, co-working spaces, parks, etc.)  
- Visualizations using GIS or interactive dashboards  
- Optional: lightweight app prototype to recruit participants and collect data

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Discovery of actual popular areas among Seoul youth — beyond commonly assumed hotspots  
- Data-driven program allocation: workshops, career services, mental health pop-ups, etc.  
- Support for more responsive, flexible, and location-aware public services  
- Potential expansion to other age groups or cities in the future

## ⚠️ Notes  
- This project does **not** aim to track individuals continuously or without consent.  
- Privacy and anonymization techniques must be carefully implemented.  
- Policy application may vary by district, requiring local government coordination.  
- Car ownership may bias the sample — consideration of non-car users is essential in future extensions.
