# 🧠 Project Title: AI Guard — Always-On Scam & Fake Content Detector

## 🔍 Summary
AI Guard is a **VPN-like always-on protection service** that detects suspicious links, scam websites, and AI-generated fake content in real time.  
Unlike traditional telecom security that only blocks known malicious sites, AI Guard emphasizes **explainable warnings** and **AI-driven content detection**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Existing services (e.g., U+ Information Protection) rely on **blacklists/DNS filtering**, effective only for *known* malicious domains.  
- Modern scams use **AI-generated text, fake news, deepfake images/videos**, which are much harder to detect.  
- Users often ignore generic warnings (“Unsafe site”) without understanding *why*.  

**Goal:** Build an **always-on AI-powered protection layer** that not only blocks but **explains risks clearly**.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- AI makes fake websites, news, and investment scams look real and professional.  
- Traditional protection cannot keep up with **rapidly generated new domains** or **synthetic content**.  
- People need both **safety** and **education** — learning to spot red flags through contextual explanations.  
- Inspired by telecom services but expanded with **AI detection + explainability + personalization**.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Domain reputation APIs (URLVoid, APIVoid, VirusTotal).  
- WHOIS domain registration records.  
- Public phishing/malware datasets.  
- Fake news datasets (LIAR, Fakeddit, Kaggle).  
- Community-submitted suspicious URLs.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Traffic Monitoring Layer**  
   - Always-on VPN/DNS-like filter checks all links in real time.  

2. **AI Content Detection**  
   - NLP models detect AI-generated scam patterns (fake promises, spammy reviews).  
   - Computer vision to analyze deepfake/forged images.  

3. **Explainable Warnings**  
   - Instead of just “Unsafe,” provide reasons:  
     - “Domain registered 2 weeks ago.”  
     - “AI-generated text pattern detected.”  
     - “Suspicious redirects present.”  

4. **Community Feedback Loop**  
   - User reports feed back into detection system → improves continuously.  

5. **Personalized Filtering**  
   - Focus areas (e.g., investment scams, fake news, phishing).  
   - Adjustable sensitivity for different users.

## 💡 Applications
- Protect individuals from scams, phishing, and misinformation.  
- Help users learn to recognize AI-generated deception.  
- Enterprise: advanced link/content filtering for employees.  
- Social benefit: reduce the spread of fake news and fraud.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Must ensure **privacy protection** (no unnecessary data logging).  
- Need robust fact-checking to avoid false positives.  
- User interface should be simple and friendly, not technical.  
- Requires continuous updates as scam tactics evolve.
