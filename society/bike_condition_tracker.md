# 🧠 Project Title: Bike Condition Tracker — Crowdsourcing and IoT for Shared Bikes

## 🔍 Summary
Bike Condition Tracker improves the **user experience of shared bikes** (e.g., Seoul’s 따릉이) by adding real-time insights on bike condition.  
Through **crowdsourced ratings** and optional **IoT sensor data**, it helps riders choose reliable bikes while enabling operators to optimize maintenance.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Shared bikes often have **uneven quality**: some nearly broken, others smooth.  
- Current systems only show **availability**, not **ride condition**.  
- Riders waste time or feel unsafe when choosing faulty bikes.  
- Operators lack **data-driven tools** for proactive maintenance.  

**Goal:** Provide a system that improves safety, usability, and operational efficiency by tracking bike health.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Shared mobility services are rapidly expanding but face **trust and quality concerns**.  
- Traditional maintenance relies on fixed cycles, ignoring real usage.  
- A **data-driven feedback loop** can balance rider satisfaction and maintenance costs.  
- Crowdsourcing and IoT offer scalable, low-cost solutions to this challenge.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- User-submitted ride condition ratings (brakes, chain, saddle, tires).  
- Open data on public bike maintenance records.  
- IoT sensor data: vibration, brake pressure, mileage, GPS.  
- Geospatial data for station mapping and analysis.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Crowdsourced Ratings**  
   - Mobile app feature for post-ride checklists.  
   - Aggregate into a **Bike Health Score** displayed on maps.  

2. **IoT Sensor Integration**  
   - Lightweight sensors capturing vibration, braking, and usage data.  
   - Predictive maintenance using anomaly detection and usage patterns.  

3. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - Match bikes to user preferences (e.g., softer brakes, smoother ride).  
   - AI suggests best-fit bikes within a station.  

4. **Visualization & Analytics**  
   - Rider map with real-time condition scores.  
   - Operator dashboard for maintenance prioritization.  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Riders:** safer, more enjoyable rides with reliable bikes.  
- **Operators:** reduced costs via predictive servicing.  
- **Cities:** improved adoption and trust in public bike systems.  
- **Extensions:** gamification (points for ratings), navigation app integration.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Requires enough **crowdsourced participation** to be reliable.  
- IoT hardware must remain **low-cost and durable**.  
- Must balance user privacy with tracking accuracy.
