# 🧠 Project Title  
**Bike Condition Tracker: Crowdsourcing and IoT for Shared Bikes**  

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to improve the **user experience of shared bikes** (like Seoul’s 따릉이) by providing real-time information on bike condition. Through **crowdsourced ratings** and optional **IoT sensors**, the system helps users choose reliable bikes while assisting operators with efficient maintenance scheduling.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Shared bikes often have **inconsistent conditions**: some are nearly broken, others ride like new.  
- Current systems only show **availability**, not **usability**.  
- Users waste time and feel unsafe when encountering poorly maintained bikes.  
- Operators lack **data-driven insights** for proactive maintenance.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Shared mobility services are expanding rapidly, raising concerns about **safety and quality**.  
- Traditional maintenance relies on fixed cycles, ignoring actual usage or condition.  
- A **data-driven approach** (crowdsourcing + IoT) can improve both user satisfaction and operational efficiency.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **User ratings** (post-ride checklists: brakes, chain, saddle, tires)  
- **Public maintenance records** (open government or operator APIs)  
- **IoT sensor data** (vibration, brake pressure, GPS for mileage)  
- **Geospatial data** for station mapping and analysis  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
1. **Crowdsourced Condition Ratings**  
   - Mobile app: users rate bikes after riding  
   - Aggregate into a **“Bike Health Score”** visible on maps  

2. **IoT Sensor Integration**  
   - Install simple sensors to capture vibration, speed, and braking  
   - Predictive maintenance using usage + anomaly detection  

3. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - User preference profile (e.g., “soft brakes,” “comfortable saddle”)  
   - AI suggests best-fit bikes in a station  

4. **Visualization & Analytics**  
   - Interactive map showing real-time bike health  
   - Dashboard for operators to prioritize maintenance

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- **Riders**: safer and more enjoyable rides by avoiding faulty bikes  
- **Operators**: lower maintenance costs through predictive servicing  
- **Cities**: improved trust and adoption of public bike systems  
- **Extensions**: integration with navigation apps, or gamification (points for rating bikes)
