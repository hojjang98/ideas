# 🧠 Project Title  
**GreenReceipt: Eco-Friendly Digital Receipt Management Platform**

---

## 🔍 Summary  
GreenReceipt is a **digital receipt hub** that eliminates paper receipts and provides a unified platform for consumers, merchants, and governments. Receipts are automatically collected through payment systems and stored in the app. Consumers can analyze spending habits, merchants can manage sales and showcase eco-friendly practices, and governments can use aggregated data for statistical and environmental monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Paper receipts are harmful to the environment (e.g., BPA-coated thermal paper is hard to recycle).  
- Consumers usually discard receipts quickly, making management inconvenient.  
- Merchants bear the cost of paper and printer maintenance.  
- While e-receipts exist, **standardization and large-scale data utilization are lacking**.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Millions of paper receipts are discarded daily in countries like South Korea.  
- In the era of carbon neutrality and ESG, small changes can lead to impactful environmental practices.  
- Just as financial transaction data powers fintech services, **receipt data can fuel personalized consumer insights and eco-friendly participation metrics**.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Payment provider APIs (e.g., KakaoPay, Toss, PayPal, Stripe)  
- Merchant POS system integrations  
- Public environmental data (e.g., paper consumption, carbon emission statistics)  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **OCR-based receipt scanning** → early adoption stage  
- **API integrations** with card companies and payment providers → long-term goal  
- **Consumer behavior analysis** via clustering and time-series modeling  
- **Carbon footprint visualization** dashboards to show environmental impact reduction  

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- **Consumers**: Understand spending habits + gain eco-participation metrics  
- **Merchants**: Save costs + ESG reporting support  
- **Society**: Reduce paper waste, promote environmental sustainability  

---

## 🔎 Existing Solutions vs. GreenReceipt  
- E-receipts already exist (email/SMS/app-based).  
- Corporate expense management tools (e.g., Infor, N2F, Moss) focus on **expense automation**.  
- Retail platforms (e.g., Vynamic Digital Receipt) emphasize **customer convenience**.  
- **GreenReceipt’s differentiation**: A **data hub** that connects consumers, merchants, and governments, focusing on **environmental impact + standardized analytics**.
