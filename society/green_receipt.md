# 🧠 Project Title: GreenReceipt — Eco-Friendly Digital Receipt Management Platform

## 🔍 Summary
GreenReceipt is a **digital receipt hub** that replaces paper receipts with a unified platform for consumers, merchants, and governments.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Paper receipts are harmful to the environment (e.g., BPA-coated thermal paper is non-recyclable).  
- Consumers discard receipts quickly, making expense tracking inconvenient.  
- Merchants incur ongoing costs for paper and printer maintenance.  
- Existing e-receipts lack **standardization** and **large-scale data integration**.  

**Goal:** Create a **centralized, eco-friendly receipt system** that benefits users, businesses, and society.
