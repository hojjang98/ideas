# 🧠 Project Title: Restart Together — Social Recovery Platform After Holidays

## 🔍 Summary
After long holidays like Chuseok, many people struggle to regain rhythm in their daily lives.  
**Restart Together** helps users recover motivation and rebuild routines **through collective support** rather than doing it alone.  
It turns post-holiday recovery into a shared challenge — emphasizing empathy, encouragement, and gradual progress.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- People often lose their daily rhythm after holidays (e.g., irregular sleep, diet, study habits).  
- Individual efforts to recover tend to fail due to **lack of external accountability**.  
- Current habit or routine apps are **too individual-focused**, ignoring the role of social motivation.  

**Goal:**  
Build a platform that transforms post-holiday recovery into a **collaborative process** — blending emotional support, gamified routine tracking, and community-driven accountability.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Psychological studies show that **social belonging enhances resilience** and improves adherence to behavioral goals.  
- Sharing progress (even minimal) reduces self-blame and boosts motivation.  
- Post-holiday burnout or slump is a recurring cycle — collective recovery can normalize and soften that transition.

## ⚙️ Key Features
### 1. **Group Recovery Challenges**
- Join “7-day Reboot” or “14-day Focus Reset” groups.  
- Shared progress boards instead of leaderboards (no competition).  
- Encouragement badges like *“You showed up today!”*  

### 2. **Emotion & Energy Tracking**
- Daily self-check with mood + energy sliders.  
- Team mood visualization (e.g., “Team Average Energy: 68%”).  
- AI detects collective fatigue → suggests rest or lighter tasks.

### 3. **Social Reinforcement System**
- When one member logs back in after inactivity, teammates send supportive messages automatically.  
- Positive feedback loops: “You came back! 3 teammates noticed 💬”  

### 4. **Reflection & Growth Log**
- Weekly reflection prompts (“What helped you bounce back this week?”).  
- Generates “Resilience Timeline” graph showing ups & downs together.

---

## 💡 Future Expansion
- Extend beyond holidays → project burnout, exam recovery, fitness comeback, breakup recovery.  
- Integration with workplace wellness programs or student communities.  
- Potential tie-ins with mental health APIs for emotion analysis or coaching.
