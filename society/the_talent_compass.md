# 🧠 Project Title: The Talent Compass — Personal Creative Asset Platform

## 🔍 Summary
The Talent Compass systematically collects all **non-traditional projects, learning experiences, and creative attempts** made by an individual throughout their life. It evaluates them with an objective **Creative Value Score (CVS)**, enabling users to leverage these assets for future opportunities (e.g., jobs, collaboration, investment).

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Society, especially in contexts like South Korea, lacks objective standards to recognize personal creative attempts outside of **formal education and traditional work experience.**
- Individuals struggle to accumulate and perceive failed projects or hobby learning as **'assets'**.
- Companies and teams find it difficult to gauge an applicant's potential **'execution ability'** and **'problem-solving skills'** using only conventional resumes.

**Goal:** To assign objective value to non-formal experiences and build an **'Execution-Driven Portfolio'** to maximize individual potential.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- **Lifelong Learning & Multi-Job Era:** Individuals are accumulating diverse experiences, but there is no integrated tool to present them.
- **Reframing Failure:** Need to convert inevitable creative trial-and-error (failure) from 'waste' into a **'learning asset'**.
- **Technical Feasibility:** Advances in AI analysis allow for the measurement of potential through **quantifiable data** (e.g., code commits, documentation frequency).

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- **Development/Coding:** Activity logs from GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow.
- **Documentation/Planning:** Project document creation/revision history from Notion, Trello, Google Drive.
- **Content/Creation:** Upload and activity data from YouTube, Blogs, Medium/Brunch, Behance.
- **Personal Logs:** (With user consent) Idea records and learning journals.
- **Certifications:** Online course completions, hackathon participation records.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Experience Gathering Agents:** Use OAuth2.0 to link accounts and gather data periodically; utilize Webhooks for real-time activity changes.
2. **Creative Value Scoring (CVS):** AI algorithm assigns an objective score based on extracted data. **Metrics include:** **Originality Score** (Novelty vs. existing projects), **Sustainability Score** (Consistency of updates), **Execution Difficulty** (Complexity of tech stack/challenge).
3. **Intelligent Portfolio Generation:** User inputs a purpose (e.g., 'Startup Developer Interview', 'Pitching for Investment'), and the platform automatically **reconfigures and generates a customized portfolio** using scored assets.
4. **Failure-as-Asset Management:** Scores and visualizes failed projects based on **Execution Difficulty** and **Lessons Learned**, making them valuable inputs for future success.

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Individuals:** Converting hobby projects and side learning into recognized career assets.
- **Recruiters/Investors:** Data-driven assessment of applicant's *potential* and *execution mindset*, beyond academic records.
- **Educators:** Tools to visualize a student's holistic, non-curricular learning path.
- **Extensions:** Mentorship matching based on CVS gaps, automatic skill gap identification.

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Requires robust **data security and privacy** protocols due to the sensitive nature of linked personal data.
- **CVS algorithm transparency** is critical for user trust and widespread adoption.
- Needs official integration or validation (e.g., with HR platforms) to gain real-world acceptance.
