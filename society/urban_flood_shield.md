# 🧠 Project Title  
**Urban Flood Shield: AI-Powered Flood Prediction and Real-Time Response System**

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to combine **weather data, IoT sensor networks, and urban drainage/traffic data** to predict flood-prone areas within cities and provide real-time alerts. The prediction results will be delivered immediately to citizens and relevant authorities to minimize urban damage.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Sudden heavy rainfall can cause **urban flooding**, resulting in significant loss of life and property.  
- Existing alert systems rely on **nationwide weather forecasts**, lacking **neighborhood-level risk information**.  
- Most systems are focused on post-disaster response, with limited preventative capabilities.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Due to **climate change**, localized heavy rain events have been increasing in frequency and severity.  
- Urban drainage systems often reach **capacity limits** quickly during extreme weather.  
- A combination of real-time data and AI-based forecasting is needed to reduce damage.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **Weather data**: National weather service APIs, radar/satellite precipitation data  
- **Geographic information**: Elevation, terrain, river locations, drainage maps  
- **IoT sensor data**: Sewer water levels, road flooding sensors, rain gauges  
- **Traffic data**: Vehicle speed drop zones (as flooding indicators)  
- **Historical flood damage records**  

---

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
1. **Short-term rainfall prediction** using LSTM or ConvLSTM models  
2. **Flood vulnerability mapping** via Gradient Boosting with terrain and drainage capacity data  
3. **Real-time risk mapping** from live IoT sensor data  
4. **Public alert application** with navigation-based detour guidance  
5. **Integrated alerts for emergency response agencies**  

---

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- **Neighborhood-level flood risk maps**  
- **Navigation-integrated detour suggestions** to avoid flooded roads  
- **Faster localized alerts** than conventional disaster text messages  
- **Data-driven prioritization** for drainage system upgrades in urban planning
