# 🧠 Project Title: Urban Noise Palette — Mapping City Sounds into Colors

## 🔍 Summary
Urban Noise Palette captures and analyzes **city sounds** across different locations, mapping their **frequency spectra into color palettes**.  
By transforming noise into a visual medium, it creates an **intuitive and artistic representation of urban soundscapes**, bridging environmental monitoring with public engagement.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Traditional noise measurement focuses on **decibel levels (dB)**, which ignore the *quality and character* of sound.  
- Residents and policymakers struggle to grasp **what types of sounds dominate** urban life using numbers alone.  
- There is a lack of tools that combine **scientific accuracy** with **publicly accessible visualization**.  

**Goal:** Reframe noise as not just pollution, but as **data with meaning**, making it visible and interpretable.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Environmental visualization is gaining traction as a way to **influence awareness and urban policy**.  
- Not all noise is harmful — cicadas in summer are loud but meaningful, showing that **context matters**.  
- By linking sound → frequency → color, people can **see the “palette” of a city’s atmosphere**.  
- This blend of **environmental science + digital art** can engage both citizens and planners.  

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- **UrbanSound8K** and other open urban audio datasets.  
- Field recordings with microphones / portable recorders.  
- Public APIs from noise monitoring stations.  
- GIS shapefiles for integrating palettes with city maps.  

---

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **Sound Collection**  
   - Record across multiple city spots and times (rush hour, night, seasonal).  

2. **Frequency Analysis**  
   - Use FFT to extract noise spectrum characteristics.  

3. **Color Mapping**  
   - Map frequency ranges to RGB or perceptual color scales (e.g., low = blue, mid = green, high = red).  

4. **Spatial Visualization**  
   - Overlay palettes on maps with GIS integration.  
   - Generate interactive dashboards or heatmaps.  

5. **Temporal Dimension**  
   - Create time-lapse views showing palette shifts across days/seasons.  

---

## 💡 Applications
- **Visual noise maps** that show *what kind* of noise dominates, not just how loud.  
- **Public awareness campaigns** highlighting harmful vs. meaningful noise.  
- **Art installations** that project live city sounds into colors.  
- **Urban planning input** for acoustic redesign of problem areas.  
- **Citizen science engagement**: users contribute sound recordings to expand the dataset.  

---

## ⚠️ Notes
- Noise perception is subjective; color mappings may need calibration for clarity.  
- Field data must consider microphone sensitivity and environmental bias.  
- Must distinguish between **ambient sound** (neutral/meaningful) and **noise pollution** (harmful).
