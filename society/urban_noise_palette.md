# 🧠 Project Title  
**Urban Noise Palette: Mapping City Sounds into Colors**  

---

## 🔍 Summary  
This project visualizes **urban noise** by recording sounds across different city locations and mapping their **frequency spectrum to colors**. By comparing noise “palettes” for various places and times of day, it provides an intuitive and artistic way to understand urban soundscapes.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Traditional noise measurement relies mainly on **decibel (dB)** values, which fail to capture the *character* of sounds.  
- People find it hard to grasp the **quality and variety** of urban noise through numbers alone.  

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- Environmental data visualization is gaining traction as a tool for public awareness and policy-making.  
- Sound is often treated as pollution, but not all noise is meaningless. For example, cicadas are loud in summer, but their sound is a survival mechanism and part of the seasonal atmosphere. This reminds us that **noise can also hold meaning**, not just be an annoyance.  
- Merging environmental monitoring with artistic expression can engage both the public and decision-makers.

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- **Urban sound datasets** (e.g., UrbanSound8K)  
- Field recordings using microphones or portable recorders  
- Open environmental noise monitoring APIs  
- GIS shapefiles for city mapping

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
1. **Sound collection** at multiple urban locations and times  
2. **FFT-based frequency analysis** to extract spectrum data  
3. **Color mapping** (e.g., low frequency = blue, mid = green, high = red)  
4. **GIS integration** to overlay sound palettes on city maps  
5. **Time-lapse visualization** to track changes in noise profiles over days or seasons

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- **Visual noise maps** showing not just loudness but the nature of urban sounds  
- **Awareness campaigns** that highlight harmful vs. meaningful noises  
- **Art installations** that translate real-time city sounds into color projections  
- **Urban planning input** to identify areas needing acoustic redesign
