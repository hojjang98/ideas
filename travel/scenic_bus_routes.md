# 🧠 Project Title: Scenic Bus Routes — Hidden Beauty in Public Transport

## 🔍 Summary
Instead of evaluating bus routes only by **punctuality** or **congestion**, this project introduces a new dimension: **scenery**.  
By leveraging bus GPS and route data, we identify and recommend the most beautiful bus rides — perfect for **tourists, dates, or simply relaxing commutes**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Current evaluations of bus routes focus on **efficiency metrics** (speed, punctuality, congestion).  
- The **scenic value** of routes is often ignored, despite many people enjoying the view from a bus window.  
- Tourists often prefer buses over subways to experience cityscapes, but scenic routes are only shared through word-of-mouth.  

**Goal:** Reframe bus routes as **scenic experiences**, not just transit, by using data-driven analysis.

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Navigation apps like Google Maps or Naver Maps only optimize for **time** and **cost**, never for experience.  
- Massive GPS and route datasets already exist in public transport — offering potential for **re-interpretation and visualization**.  
- With the rise of **experience-based consumption**, repositioning bus rides as **urban scenic journeys** could resonate strongly.  
- Personally, I’ve always enjoyed **looking out the bus window** and finding hidden beauty in everyday commutes — this project grew from that simple joy.
