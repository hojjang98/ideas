# 🧠 Project Title: **Travel With Whom: Context-Aware Review Mining**

## 🔍 Summary  
This project aims to build a review mining system that extracts and classifies contextual cues such as **"who the user traveled with"** (e.g., parents, friends, partner, alone) from user-generated content. By aligning reviews with user compositions, it provides context-aware insights and improves the relevance of travel recommendations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Traditional review systems (e.g., Google Maps, TripAdvisor) do not account for the travel companion context, despite its major influence on user experience. A place enjoyable for couples may be unsuitable for family trips. Without this context, users find it hard to filter relevant reviews, leading to suboptimal travel decisions.

## 📚 Background & Motivation  
- **Context**: Travel experiences vary significantly based on who you’re traveling with—family, friends, a partner, or solo.  
- **Motivation**: When planning a trip, users often look for relatable reviews but struggle to find those aligned with their situation.  
- **Pain point**: "I want to know how parents with kids felt about this place—not just random visitors."

## 📊 Potential Data Sources  
- Public reviews from Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Naver, KakaoMap  
- User-generated travel blogs or Instagram captions (with hashtags like #familytrip)  
- Crowdsourced review collection with structured inputs (e.g., "Who did you travel with?")  
- Optional: user surveys for evaluation and validation

## 🧪 Possible Approaches  
- **NLP-based context classification**  
  - Use BERT or LLM-based models to detect phrases like "went with my mom", "my girlfriend loved it", etc.  
  - Fine-tune sentiment models by group type  
- **Tag-based review collection UI**  
  - Offer manual tagging options for future users (e.g., dropdown: [family, couple, solo, friends])  
- **Aggregate sentiment dashboards**  
  - Show average ratings by user group (e.g., “Couples rated 4.6, Families 3.2”)  
- **Optional recommender layer**  
  - Suggest places based on similar group patterns and reviews

## 💡 Expected Insights or Applications  
- Improved relevance in travel recommendation systems  
- Interactive dashboards visualizing rating variance by group  
- Prototype mobile app or web extension  
- Collaboration potential with local governments or tourism agencies

## ⚠️ Notes  
- This system aims to **supplement**, not replace, traditional reviews  
- Privacy risks in text mining need to be mitigated  
- Reviews should be summarized effectively to prevent information overload
