# 🧠 Project Title: Travel With Whom — Context-Aware Review Mining

## 🔍 Summary
This project develops a **review mining system** that identifies and classifies contextual cues about **travel companions** (e.g., family, friends, partner, solo).  
By aligning reviews with companion type, it enables **context-aware recommendations** and helps users make travel decisions based on situations most relevant to them.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Current review systems (Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Naver, KakaoMap) treat all reviews equally, regardless of **who the reviewer traveled with**.  
- A place great for couples may be inconvenient for families with children.  
- Users often want relatable reviews (*“What did parents say about this spot?”*), but filtering is impossible with traditional systems.  

**Goal:** Build a system that integrates **companion context** into review analysis for more personalized recommendations.

---

## 📚 Background & Motivation
- Travel experiences are shaped heavily by **social context** — solo, with friends, with parents, or with a partner.  
- Many users express frustration when reviews lack relevance to their situation.  
- Example pain point: *“This café was rated highly, but with kids it was terrible — no high chairs, no space.”*  
- This project bridges that gap by mining context from text and surfacing **companion-aware insights**.

---

## 📊 Potential Data Sources
- Public user reviews from Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Naver, KakaoMap.  
- Travel blogs and Instagram captions with hashtags (#familytrip, #couplegetaway).  
- Crowdsourced structured reviews with explicit tags (family, couple, solo, friends).  
- User surveys for validation and evaluation of classification accuracy.

## 🧪 Technical Approach
1. **NLP Context Classification**  
   - Fine-tune BERT/LLM models to detect phrases like “went with my girlfriend”, “traveled with kids”.  
   - Train sentiment classifiers by group type.  

2. **Tagging System for Future Reviews**  
   - Add dropdowns (family, couple, solo, friends) for structured input.  

3. **Aggregate Analytics Dashboard**  
   - Visualize **average ratings by group** (e.g., Couples = 4.6, Families = 3.2).  

4. **Context-Aware Recommender Layer (Optional)**  
   - Suggest destinations based on group-specific satisfaction trends.

## 💡 Applications
- More relevant travel recommendations tuned to **who you’re traveling with**.  
- Tourism dashboards for governments and agencies to improve policies.  
- Web/mobile prototype for companion-aware trip planning.  
- Extensions to other domains: restaurants, activities, accommodations.

## ⚠️ Notes
- This project supplements, not replaces, traditional reviews.  
- Must carefully mitigate **privacy risks** in mining text for personal details.  
- Summarization is key to avoid information overload from group-segmented reviews.
